A project seeking to understand the effect of complex forest structure on the spatial spread of the western pine beetle using an agent-based modeling approach coupled with drone-derived forest structure and tree mortality data 
across a 1000m elevational and 350km latitudinal gradient in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California.

This project relies on MASON [1], the Multi-Agent Simulator Of Neighborhoods... or Networks... or something... It can be downloaded from here: https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/

I run MASON using Eclipse. If you're on a Mac, follow these instructions to get the software setup: https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/extensions/eclipse/
