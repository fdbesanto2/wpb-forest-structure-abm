abstract = {Forest insect outbreaks can impose significant tree mortality across vast forested landscapes. The current epidemic of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, for example, has led to the mortality of pine trees in western Canada and the U.S. spanning tens of millions of hectares. The ecological processes driving mountain pine beetle outbreaks are governed by multiple feedback mechanisms, thresholds, and external constraints that exist along a spatial continuum from individual insect-tree interactions to landscape level change. These components of mountain pine beetle epidemics need to be explicitly parameterized in modeling efforts that aim to predict where insect disturbance will occur in a forest each year and the amount of tree mortality that will ensue as a result. However, do date, minimal efforts exist that examine how local level interactions between beetles and trees translate into broader patterns of tree mortality, and those that do are limited to relatively local scales. In this study, we present an agent-based model that simulates how tree mortality results from the combination of beetle-tree interactions, beetle-to-beetle communication, tree defense to beetle attack, beetle density dynamics, host tree availability, dispersal behavior, and landscape heterogeneity. Our model is tested using data from an area in central British Columbia, Canada, that is near the center of the current outbreak in that region. The model simulates both overall tree mortality and spatial patterns of tree mortality, producing results that are similar to those observed in aerial surveys of tree health. Moving forward, the computational efficiency of our model demonstrates the capability to be applied to large, regional landscapes when implemented with sufficient computing resources. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The widespread outbreaks of Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) are responsible for infestations of lodgepole pine forests since 1990 in Canada. In British Columbia, this forest insect disturbance has resulted in losses of more than 13. million hectares of pine trees. The complexity of the MPB emergence, aggregation and attack behaviour is captured by this study, using an intelligent agent-based model (ABM) of beetle outbreaks at a local scale of individual trees. Agent-based approach permits simulation of interactions that describe the ecological context in which insect populations spread. Intelligent reasoning is introduced by a swarm intelligence (SI) algorithm integrated with the ABM that depicts indirect communication, collective behaviour and self-organized aggregation of insects in a forest ecosystem. The objectives of this study are the following: 1) to develop ForestSimMPB model that integrates SI and ABM within a geographic information systems (GIS) framework; 2) to implement the proposed model on real datasets to simulate the MPB aggregation and mass attacks on lodgepole pine trees; and 3) to determine the spatial patterns and extents of these attacks. The ForestSimMPB is calibrated by fine tuning two model parameters, and implemented using data from three sites located in the Cariboo Regional District in the central interior of BC. The obtained results demonstrate the aggregation behaviour of MPB to collectively attack lodgepole pines, as well as portray the spatial clustering of dead trees resulting from infestation. Simulation outputs provide analysis and predictions of spatial patterns in the forest landscape structure as a result of a MPB outbreak. The developed model can be used to assist the improvement of methods for prevention and control of MPB disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Model testing procedures represent a major challenge in the development of agent-based models (ABMs). However, they are required stages for a model to be accepted and to serve as a forecasting, management or decision-making tool. This study presents a comprehensive approach for testing ForestSimMPB, an agent-based model (ABM) designed to simulate mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, outbreaks at the scale of individual trees. ForestSimMPB is a complex system model that is using swarming intelligence, capable to represent individuals' behaviours and spatial interactions that influence their surrounding environment. Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods are integrated into the ABM in order to reproduce the collective reasoning and indirect communication of autonomous agents representing MPB behaviour within the forest environment. Model testing approach consist of verification, calibration, sensitivity analysis, validation and qualification stages. Model testing is accomplished by simulating MPB infestations using both the ForestSimMPB model and a Random-ABM model that serves as a null model. Outcomes comparison and assessment are performed using raster-based techniques as well as spatial metrics. Aerial photographs of the British Columbia, Canada study sites are used in this model testing approach. Results indicate that ForestSimMPB model representations of MPB outbreaks are more similar than Random model representations to the spatial distribution of MPB-dead trees. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of object-orientation for both spatial data and spatial process models facilitates their integration, which can allow exploration and explanation of spatial-temporal phenomena. In order to better understand how tight coupling might proceed and to evaluate the possible functional and efficiency gains from such a tight coupling, we identify four key relationships affecting how geographic data (fields and objects) and agent-based process models can interact: identity, causal, temporal and topological. We discuss approaches to implementing tight integration, focusing on a middleware approach that links existing GIS and ABM development platforms, and illustrate the need and approaches with example agent-based models.},

abstract = {We use the simulation model Envision to analyze long-term wildfire
dynamics and the effects of different fuel management scenarios in
central Oregon, USA. We simulated a 50-year future where fuel management
activities were increased by doubling and tripling the current area
treated while retaining existing treatment strategies in terms of
spatial distribution and treatment type. We modeled forest succession
using a state-and-transition approach and simulated wildfires based on
the contemporary fire regime of the region. We tested for the presence
of temporal trends and overall differences in burned area among four
fuel management scenarios. Results showed that when the forest was
managed to reduce fuels it burned less: over the course of 50 years
there was up to a 40{\%} reduction in area burned. However, simulation
outputs did not reveal the expected temporal trend, i.e., area burned
did not decrease progressively with time, nor did the absence of
management lead to its increase. These results can be explained as the
consequence of an existing wildfire deficit and vegetation succession
paths that led to closed canopy, and heavy fuels forest types that are
unlikely to burn under average fire weather. Fire (and management)
remained relatively rare disturbances and, given our assumptions, were
unable to alter long-term vegetation patterns and consequently unable to
alter long-term wildfire dynamics. Doubling and tripling current
management targets were effective in the near term but not sustainable
through time because of a scarcity of stands eligible to treat according
to the modeled management constraints. These results provide new
insights into the long-term dynamics between fuel management programs
and wildfire and demonstrate that treatment prioritization strategies
have limited effect on fire activity if they are too narrowly focused on
particular forest conditions.},
